## 💡 Goals of This Repository

- Practice programming fundamentals
- Apply data structures (like linked lists, queues, stacks) in games
- Explore system-level and console I/O programming
- Build playable games using minimal external libraries

---

## 🧠 Concepts Explored

- Object-Oriented Programming in C++
- Dynamic memory management
- Platform-specific input handling (e.g. `getch`, `kbhit`, `Sleep`)
- Cross-platform compilation
- Game logic and rendering in terminal

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run
Each game resides in its own subdirectory (e.g., `snake_game`) with its own `Makefile`.
